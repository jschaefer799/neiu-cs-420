**Chosen Dataset: Data USA**

**Application Name: U.S. Manufacturing Decline**

**Project Topic/Objective**

According to the Brookings Institute (Baily and Bosworth 2014), millions of jobs have been lost in the United States manufacturing
industry since the 1980s. Today, most consumer products are produced outside of the U.S. Skilled and unskilled manufacturing jobs
have largely been replaced with low-wage service industry work.

This application aims to analyze data from the DATA USA API in order to explore the possible economic and societal ripple 
effects the U.S. has experienced during this same time period.

More specifically, this application is driven by the following core questions:

- Did U.S. wages decrease or remain stagnant (when adjusted for inflation) during this time?
- Have crime rates increased?
How have social metrics changed over time, like consumer debit, home ownership and so on?
- In parts of the country that were hit especially hard by the manufacturing industry decline, are 
the above areas of impact more severe?

**Motivation**

A significant decline in good paying jobs, such as the disappearing of the manufacturing industry, creates havoc on local, state 
and federal economies. The ripple effect, which can be more accurately described as a tidal wave, of this type of economic shift 
can be seen far beyond consumerism, in areas such as crime, healthcare access, housing, education and much more.

Working hands-on with this data from the ground up will provide me with a better understanding of the depth of the ripple effect.
