**Chosen Dataset: United States Census Bureau Annual Survey of Manufactures (Time Series 2002-2016) API**

**Application Name: U.S. Manufacturing Job Rates 2002-2016**

**Project Topic/Objective**

According to the Brookings Institute (Baily and Bosworth 2014), millions of jobs have been lost in the United 
States manufacturing industry since the 1980s. Today, most consumer products are produced outside of the United States. 
Skilled and unskilled manufacturing jobs have largely been replaced with low-wage service industry work.The purpose of 
using this Census API dataset is to look at how the United States manufacturing industry has changed over time. 

This application aims to analyze data from the U.S. Census Bureau in order to explore the specific sub-sectors that fall 
within the manufacturing industry that have been impacted the most by a loss of jobs.

More specifically, this application is driven by the following questions:

Which sub-sectors experienced the highest decrease in total jobs over the course of the dataset range (2002-2016)?

Which sub-sectors, if any, experienced increases in total jobs over the course of the dataset range?

Did the sub-sectors experience similar trends or patterns?

**Motivation**

A significant decline in good paying jobs, such as the disappearing of the manufacturing industry, creates havoc on local, state 
and federal economies. The ripple effect, which can be more accurately described as a tidal wave, of this type of economic shift 
can be seen far beyond consumerism, in areas such as crime, healthcare access, housing, education and much more.

Creating an application that can show when and which jobs declined will give me the ability to pair
this data with other socioeconomic indicators to build a robust portrayal of the impact that losing thousands of high paying jobs 
has had on middle income and low income families. Data points such as, wages, consumer debit, home ownership, crime and countless 
more, can be combined with the U.S. manufacturing data in a graphical way that shows similar (or different) trends or patterns. The 
additional data can easily be harvested from different APIs.
